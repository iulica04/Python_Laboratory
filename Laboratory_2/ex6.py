# Write a function that extract a number from a text (for example if the text is "An apple is 123 USD", this function will return 123, or if the text is "abc123abc" the function will extract 123). The function will extract only the first number that is found.

            break

    return number

    input = input("Enter the text : ")
    print("The first number that was found in your chosen text is : %s." % find_the_first_number(input))
